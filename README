Vulkan Triangle in C99 and Win32
================================

This project is an implementation of the [Vulkan Triangle official guide]
(https://docs.vulkan.org/tutorial/latest/03_Drawing_a_triangle/00_Setup/00_Base_code.html)
using C99 instead of C++ and Win32 instead of glfw. I hope to use this as the
basis for a framework for games I will make in the future. It is a complete
and commented example.


Why C99?
--------

I enjoy using a low-level and simple programming language that I can keep in
my head without too much refering to documentation. I've followed the
[suckless.org coding style](https://suckless.org/coding_style/) as I like the
coding philosphy of keeping things simple. I decided to use designated
initializers, from C99, for the structures as they are self-documenting.


Why Win32?
----------

I want to keep library depenancies to a minimum and have control over the
working details of the operating system.


MSYS2
-----

My development environment is MSYS2. I enjoy using a UNIX style programming
environment as apposed to a full blown IDE. gcc has better support for plain C
then MSVC and MSYS2 can produce native windows binaries without extra
dependancies. There is a POSIX Makefile for building the program. Vulkan
headers and libraries can be installed on MSYS2. I'm using glslc.exe that is
included in the Vulkan SDK and can be run from within MSYS2.

Required MSYS2 packages:
make
mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc
mingw-w64-x86_64-vulkan-headers
mingw-w64-x86_64-vulkan-loader
mingw-w64-x86_64-vulkan-validation-layers
